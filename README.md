# Articulate

- Simple library for dynamic content creation.


## Basics
- In the beginning Articulate started as a generator for articles heavily inspired by medium and if you're working on a client website with blog or article content, this would be a nice thing you add to the blog creation page of the CMS.

```javascript
new Articulate("#writeBlog", {
    
})
```
